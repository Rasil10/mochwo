        millions of people. In the mean time they are the most vulnerable to rapid environmental change. The international conference on “Mountains in
        the Changing World” aims to provide a forum for international/national scholars, researchers, policy maker and students with opportunity to share
        their research findings and knowledge related to various aspects of mountains. We are sure that this conference can be an effective and insightful
        for the benefit of people depending on mountains. The #MoChWo will be held in Kathmandu, Nepal. Kathmandu is known for long history, ancient cultures
        and civilizations, Hindu and Buddhist temples, architecture &amp; sculptures. It hosts seven UNESCO world heritage sites. Kathmandu is also the gateway of
